# A Simple Gesture Recognition Model
This is a simple gesture recognition model that I built with Raspberry pi 4, including a picamera and two random servos.
It is not finished currently, since I am not doing children's work, I want the project to be meaningful and useful.
The source code are now separate, but it will be dealt in the future.
## Contents
> There are two folders in the repo:
1. Servos Control
2. Camera Control
---------------------------------------------------------------
### Servos Control
This part include a C++ code designed to control the movement of two servo motors using a Raspberry Pi 4.
It demonstrates basic GPIO manipulation and real-time motor coordination, very basic project for robotics experiments or embedded systems prototyping.
### Camera Control
This part include a Python code designed to control the camera using the picamera(The cheapest one).
It demonstrates basic OpenCV usage on a camera and a very simple tensorflow AI stuff.
*NOTE: The tensorflow part might be substitute by pytorch in the future!*
