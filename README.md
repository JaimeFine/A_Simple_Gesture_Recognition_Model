# Two_Servos_Movement
This is an extremely basic and lightweight C++ project designed to control the movement of two servo motors using a Raspberry Pi 4.
It demonstrates basic GPIO manipulation and real-time motor coordination, very basic project for robotics experiments or embedded systems prototyping.
In the future I will integrate the servos with pi-camera and combine it with python.
